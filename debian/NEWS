cli-common (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

With this upload of cli-common 0.4.0, there is now a new version of the
CLI Policy DRAFT.
You can either find the new version at
/usr/share/doc/cli-common/
or at:
http://pkg-mono.alioth.debian.org/cli-common/

For package maintainers:
You should read the updated CLI Policy DRAFT and update your packages.
The "cli-common (>= 0.2.0)" build-dependency must be changed to
"cli-common-dev (>= 0.4.0)", because cli-common includes now scripts which are
required for the runtime.
With that the debhelper scripts were moved to be more correct place in
cli-common-dev.
